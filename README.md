🛡️ **Use Case Coverage** is a powerful developer tool designed to bridge the gap between feature specifications and test implementations. It helps you track, calculate, and visualize your test coverage against declared use cases, features, and bugs using a simple yet strict `.ucc` YAML format. 

🤖 **AI-Ready Quality Assurance**: In the age of AI-driven development, tracking the coverage of your AI agents is vital for maintaining software excellence. **UseCaseCoverage (UCC)** empowers you to measure that impact with precision and ease. ✨

🧞 **Privacy First & Zero Infrastructure**: UseCaseCoverage is designed to run entirely on your local machine or within your CI pipeline. There is **no backend**, no data is ever uploaded to any server, and your specifications remain completely private and secure. Since it is a standalone CLI tool, there is no infrastructure to host or maintain.


## 📦 Installation

Assuming you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, you can get up and running in seconds:

```bash
brew install ucc
```

---

## 🛠 Usage

Tracking your coverage with UCC follows a simple three-step workflow:

1. 📝 **Define your Specs**: Write your features, use cases, bugs, and regressions in the simple `.ucc` YAML format anywhere in your project.
2. 🏷️ **Annotate your Tests**: Include the unique ID of your artifacts in your test code (as a comment or within a string). UCC scans your codebase to find these matches automatically.
3. 🚀 **Generate & Analyze**: Run `ucc report` to compute coverage metrics and generate a beautiful, interactive dashboard. You can exeucte ``ucc`` locally or integrate it in your CI/CD pipeline.

### ✅ Linting `.ucc` files

Ensure your specifications are perfect before generating reports. The `lint` command validates your `.ucc` files recursively.

```bash
ucc lint
```

> **Tip:** You can specify an input directory or an output file for automated audits:
> ```bash
> ucc lint --input ./specs --output lint-results.txt
> ```

### 📊 Generating Visual Reports

Transform your YAML files into a stunning, interactive HTML dashboard that visualizes your project's health.

```bash
ucc report
```

By default, reports are neatly organized in `.ucc/reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>`.

## 📄 The `.ucc` Format

UseCaseCoverage relies on `.ucc` files—standard YAML files that live alongside your code.

### ✨ Basic Structure

```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"

feature:
  id: user-authentication
  title: User Authentication
  created_at: "2026-05-10"
  description: >
    Handles user login, signup, and session management.

related_features: []

artifacts:
  - id: ucc-auth-001
    title: Successful login with valid credentials
    priority: high
    created_at: "2026-05-10"
    steps:
      - Enter username
      - Enter password
      - Click submit
    expected:
      - User is redirected to dashboard

  - id: bug-auth-001
    type: bug
    title: Login fails on slow connections
    priority: highest
    created_at: "2026-05-10"
    related: [ucc-auth-001]
    tags: [auth, secure]
    platforms: [web, android, ios]
    coverage_gap_reason: "Impossible to test on Android automatically"
```

### 🧩 Key Components

- **Use Cases**: Standard artifacts capturing user requirements.
- **Bugs & Regressions**: Explicitly tracked items with `type: bug` or `type: regression`.
- **Cross-Platform Tracking**: Granularly track coverage across `android`, `apple`, `web`, `windows`, or any other platform you define in the `platforms` field.
- **Coverage Gaps**: Document known missing coverage with `coverage_gap_reason` to keep the team informed about missing automated coverage.
